Werbcorp-crawler
================

This is a set of simple tools for postprocessing results acquired, for instance,
from a web corpus. The tools included here are especially relevant for
cases when 

- concordance results provided by the corpus's interface cannot be easily fetched
as json, csv etc.
- the corpus doesn't contain all the kinds of annotations you would like to have
and you want to add these annotations to individual concordance results afterwards.


Installation
============

Via pip:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/utacorpora/webcorpcrawler
```
